            <h2>Introduction to League of Legends</h2>
            <p>League of Legends, often referred to as LoL, is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Riot Games. In the game, players assume the role of a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other player-controlled champions or computer-controlled champions. The goal is to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", a structure that lies at the heart of their base protected by defensive structures.</p>

            <h2>The Map</h2>
            <p>The action in League of Legends takes place on Summoner's Rift, a map distinguished by three primary lanes and an expansive "jungle." Traditionally since Season 1, teams have aligned themselves with well-defined roles: Top Laners hold the fort in the top lane, Mid Laners control the middle of the map, and Support and Attack Damage Carries (ADC) synergize in the bottom lane.
                Junglers, on the other hand, focus on the jungle, harvesting neutral objectives for experience points. While there's flexibility in strategy, Top Laners often play as tanks to absorb damage for their team. Mid Laners usually take on a secondary carry role, contributing significant damage and crowd control.
                The Support's job revolves around providing 'peel' - a term that refers to the act of protecting and distancing enemies from the ADC - and nurturing their Damage Carries into late-game powerhouses, where they become the team's primary source of damage.
                Meanwhile, the Jungler has a dynamic role, performing "ganks" to create advantages. "Ganking" refers to the act of ambushing unsuspecting enemies in the lanes, often leading to kills or major advantages. In addition, the Jungler also controls neutral objectives to secure buffs for the team.</p>

            <h2>Worlds</h2>
            <p>Worlds is the annual professional tournament for League of Legends, hosted by Riot Games. It's the culmination of the competitive season and is significant because it brings together the best teams from each regional league around the globe. These teams compete fiercely for the highly coveted Summoner's Cup, monetary prizes, and most importantly, the title of World Champions.
                The participating regions include North America (NA LCS), Europe (LEC), China (LPL), South Korea (LCK), and several emerging regions such as Latin America (LLA), Oceania (OPL), Southeast Asia (PCS), and others.
                Historically, teams from South Korea's LCK and China's LPL have had the most success at Worlds. South Korean teams dominated the early years of the tournament, thanks to their strategic approach to the game and strong emphasis on team coordination. However, in recent years, Chinese teams have emerged as a powerhouse, showcasing aggressive and decisive playstyles.
                Worlds is vitally important for many reasons. It sets the global standard for professional League of Legends play, highlights meta-defining strategies, and showcases extraordinary individual performances.</p>
